THIS README.md is all about ASSIGN.txt 
FOR THE FIRST QUESTION HERE IS THE EXPLANATION
  The quoted Terraform script of assignment_1 defines and deploys AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IAC) principles. Let's break down the script step by step and provide an explanation for each part:

1. *Provider Configuration:*
   hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1" # Change to your desired AWS region
   <!-- This section specifies the AWS provider and the desired region (in this case, "us-east-1" or the US East (N. Virginia) region). --> 
   }

   2. *VPC Creation:*
   hcl
   resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
     cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16" # You can adjust the CIDR block as needed
 <!-- This part creates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a specified CIDR block (IP address range). In this example, it's using the CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`. -->
   }

  3.  *Public Subnet Creation:*
   hcl
   resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
     vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
     cidr_block              = "10.0.1.0/24" # You can adjust the CIDR block as needed
     availability_zone       = "us-east-1a" # Change to your desired availability zone
     map_public_ip_on_launch = true
<!-- This section creates a public subnet within the VPC. It associates it with the VPC defined earlier (`aws_vpc.my_vpc`) and specifies a different CIDR block (`10.0.1.0/24`). It's set to automatically assign public IP addresses (`map_public_ip_on_launch`) to instances launched in this subnet. The subnet is placed in "us-east-1a" availability zone. -->
   }

   4. *Private Subnet Creation:*
   hcl
   resource "aws_subnet" "private_subnet" {
     vpc_id            = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
     cidr_block        = "10.0.2.0/24" # You can adjust the CIDR block as needed
     availability_zone = "us-east-1b" # Change to your desired availability zone
<!-- Similar to the public subnet, this part creates a private subnet within the same VPC. It has a different CIDR block (`10.0.2.0/24`) and is placed in "us-east-1b" availability zone. --> 
   }

   5. *EC2 Instance Creation:*
   hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Change to your desired AMI ID
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
     subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
     key_name      = "your-key-name" # Change to your key name
     root_block_device {
       volume_type = "gp2"
       volume_size = 8
     }
     tags = {
       "Name"    = "AssignmentInstance"
       "purpose" = "Assignment"
     }
   <!-- This section creates an EC2 instance using the specified Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`). It's of type `t2.micro` and is placed in the public subnet. The SSH key name is provided for authentication. The instance also has a root block device with a 8GB General Purpose (gp2) volume. Tags are added for identification. -->
   }

6. *Security Group Creation:*
   hcl
   resource "aws_security_group" "instance_security_group" {
     name_prefix = "instance-"
     description = "Security group for the EC2 instance"
   <!-- Here, a security group is defined with a name prefix and description. Security groups act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.-->
   }

7. *Security Group Rules:*
   hcl
   resource "aws_security_group_rule" "inbound_ssh" {
     type        = "ingress"
     from_port   = 22
     to_port     = 22
     protocol    = "tcp"
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
     security_group_id = aws_security_group.instance_security_group.id
   }

   resource "aws_security_group_rule" "outbound_all" {
     type        = "egress"
     from_port   = 0
     to_port     = 0
     protocol    = "-1"
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
     security_group_id = aws_security_group.instance_security_group.id

   <!-- These sections define security group rules. The first rule (`inbound_ssh`) allows inbound SSH traffic (port 22) from any source (`0.0.0.0/0`). The second rule (`outbound_all`) allows all outbound traffic. -->
   }
   
   FOR SECOND QUESTION HERE IS THE EXPLANATION


  <!-- The quoted Python program is a console-based application that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information based on user input. Now we are going to expain it while exploring it -->

1. Importing Libraries:
   python
   import requests
   
   <!-- The program starts by importing the `requests` library, which is commonly used to make HTTP requests. -->

2. OpenWeatherMap API URL:
   python
   API_URL = "https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?q=London,us&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22"
   
  <!-- This variable stores the URL of the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides hourly weather forecast data for London.-->

3. Displaying the Menu:
   python
   def display_menu():
       # Displays a menu to the user with options for fetching weather data.
   
 <!-- The `display_menu` function defines the menu options, including options to get temperature, wind speed, pressure, and to exit the program. -->

4. Getting Temperature, Wind Speed, and Pressure:
   python
   def get_temperature(date_time):
       # Fetches the temperature for a specific date and time.
   
   python
   def get_wind_speed(date_time):
       # Fetches the wind speed for a specific date and time.
   
   python
   def get_pressure(date_time):
       # Fetches the pressure for a specific date and time.
   
 <!--  These three functions are responsible for making HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API using the `requests.get` method. They then parse the JSON response to extract the relevant weather data based on the provided date and time. If the data is found, it is displayed to the user; otherwise, an error message is shown. -->

5. Main Program:
   python
   def main():
       # The main program loop that displays the menu and handles user input.
   
  <!--  The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It uses a `while` loop to repeatedly display the menu and prompt the user for input. It handles the user's choice by calling the appropriate function based on the selected option (1 for temperature, 2 for wind speed, 3 for pressure, and 0 to exit). If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed. -->

6. Running the Program:
   python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   
  <!-- This code ensures that the `main` function is executed when the script is run as the main program. It starts the program's execution.-->

The program provides a simple glance on users to fetch weather information for a specific date and time from the OpenWeatherMap API. It's organized into functions to improve modularity and readability. Users can choose an option from the menu, enter a date and time, and get the corresponding weather data.
